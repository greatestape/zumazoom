    <h1>colophon</h1>
    <p>I took 3000 pictures on my trip; an average of 275 a day. Mostly this is because I am a lousy photographer and took multiple shots to ensure at least one would look half decent. I gave up trying to use iPhoto...ever try rating, tagging and naming that many pics in iPhoto? It sucks. Plunged on Aperture and have been riding the learning curve (not as steep as I thought it would be) and sorting through the pics. Want to make sure I can put pics up with the write-up so the ADD amongst you (okay, me) can see pretty colours to go with the text.</p>
