sorl-thumbnail
==============

The sorl-thumbnail package provides an easy way to generate image
thumbnails.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.4+ and the Python Imaging Library (PIL_).
* It does not require Django_, but most features are Django specific.
  sorl-thumbnail should be compatible with all versions of Django
  (let us know if not).
* To enable PDF thumbnails you need ImageMagick_
* For Word document thumbnail handling you need ImageMagick_ and wvWare_.

.. _PIL: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
.. _ImageMagick: http://www.imagemagick.org/
.. _wvWare: http://wvware.sourceforge.net/
.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/

Installation
============

#. Download the source.
#. Put the ``sorl`` directory in your python path (I keep it in site-packages
   directory).
#. Include the thumbnail app in your ``settings.py``.

Like this::
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'sorl.thumbnail',
    )


.. _template-tag:

The {% thumbnail %} template tag
================================

The thumbnail tag creates a thumbnail if it doesn't exist or if the source
was modified more recently than the existing thumbnail. The resulting
thumbnail object contains the generated thumbnail image along with some other
potentially useful data. To use the sorl-thumbnail template tags you need to
load them in your template::
    
    {% load thumbnail %}

Basic tag Syntax::

    {% thumbnail [source] [size] [options] %}

source must be an object where ``force_unicode(object)`` returns a path to a
file relative to ``MEDIA_ROOT``. This means an Image/FileField or
string/unicode object containing the relative path to a file.


*size* can either be:

* the size in the format ``[width]x[height]`` (for example,
  ``{% thumbnail source 100x50 %}``) or

* a variable containing a valid size (i.e. either a string in the
  ``[width]x[height]`` format or a tuple containing two integers):
  ``{% thumbnail source size_string %}``.

Options
-------

Options are optional and should be a space separated.

*Note to sorl-thumbnail
vetarans: The older format of comma separated options is still supported
(with the limitation that *quality* is the only option to which you can pass
an argument to).*

Unless you change the :ref:`thumbnail-processors`, valid options are:

crop
    Crop the source image height or width to exactly match the requested
    thumbnail size (the default is to proportionally resize the source image
    to fit within the requested thumbnail size).

max
    Will resize the image to the same size as the *crop* option but it
    does not crop.

autocrop
    Remove any unnecessary whitespace from the edges of the source image.
    This occurs before the crop or propotional resize.

bw
    Make the thumbnail grayscale (not really just black & white).

upscale
    Allow upscaling of the source image during scaling.

sharpen
    Sharpen the thumbnail image (using the PIL sharpen filter)

detail
    Add detail to the image, like a mild *sharpen* (using the PIL detail
    filter)

quality=[1-100]
    Alter the quality of the JPEG thumbnail (the default is 85).

An example of basic usage::

    <img src="{% thumbnail person.photo 80x80 crop upscale %}" />


DjangoThumbnail class
---------------------
The thumbnail tag can also place a ``DjangoThumbnail`` object in the context,
providing access to the properties of the thumbnail such as the height and
width::

    {% thumbnail [source] [size] [options] as [variable] %}

When *"as [variable]"* is used, the tag does not return the absolute url of the
thumbnail. The variable (containing the ``DjangoThumbnail`` object) has the
following useful methods and properties:

absolute_url
    The absolute url of the thumbnail (the *__unicode__* method of this
    object also returns the absolute url, so you can also just do
    ``{{ thumbnail_variable }}`` in your template).

relative_url
    The relative url (to ``MEDIA_URL``) of the thumbnail.

width and height
    The width/height of the thumbnail image.

filesize
    The file size (in bytes) of the thumbnail.
    To output user-friendly file sizes, use the included :ref:`filesize-filter`
    (or Django's built-in more simplistic *filesizeformat* filter).

source_width and source_height
    The width/height of the source image.

source_filesize
    The file size of the source. Has same methods as *filesize*.


An example of advanced usage::

    {% thumbnail person.photo 250x250 bw autocrop as thumb %}
    <img src="{{ thumb }}" width="{{ thumb.width }}" height="{{ thumb.height }}" />

Debugging the thumbnail tag
---------------------------

By default, if there is an error creating the thumbnail or resolving the image
variable (1st argument) then the thumbnail tag will just return an empty
string. And if there was a context variable to be set it will also be set to an
empty string. For example, you will not see an error if the thumbnail could not
be written to directory because of permissions error. To display those errors
rather than failing silently, add a ``THUMBNAIL_DEBUG`` property to your
settings module and set it to ``True``::

	THUMBNAIL_DEBUG = True


.. _thumbnail-filenames:

Thumbnail filenames
===================

The thumbnail filename is generated from the source filename, the target size,
any options provided and the quality. For example,
``{% thumbnail "1.jpg" 80x80 crop bw %}`` will save the thumbnail image as::

    MEDIA_ROOT + '1_jpg_80x80_bw_crop_q85.jpg'

By default, thumbnails are saved in the same directory as the source image.
You can override this behaviour by adding one or more of the following
properties to your settings module::

    THUMBNAIL_BASEDIR
    THUMBNAIL_SUBDIR
    THUMBNAIL_PREFIX

Eaxmples using the tag as follows: ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}``::

    # Save thumbnail images to a directory directly off MEDIA_ROOT, still
    # keeping the relative directory structure of the source image.
    # Result: MEDIA_ROOT + 'thumbs/photos/1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'
    THUMBNAIL_BASEDIR = 'thumbs'
    
    # Save thumbnail images to a sub-directory relative to the source image.
    # Result: MEDIA_ROOT + 'photos/_thumbs/1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'
    THUMBNAIL_SUBDIR = '_thumbs'
    
    # Prepend thumnail filenames with the specified prefix.
    # Result: MEDIA_ROOT + 'photos/__1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'
    THUMBNAIL_PREFIX = '__'


Changing the default quality and image format
=============================================

If you would rather your thumbnail images have a different default JPEG
quality than 85, add a ``THUMBNAIL_QUALITY`` property to your settings module.
For example::

    THUMBNAIL_QUALITY = 95

This will only affect images which have not be explicitly given a quality
option.  By default, generated thumbnails are saved as JPEG files
(with the extension '.jpg').

PIL chooses which type of image to save as based on the extension so you can
change the default image file type by adding a ``THUMBNAIL_EXTENSION`` property
to your settings module. Note that If you change the extension, the
``THUMBNAIL_QUALITY`` will have no effect.

Example::

    THUMBNAIL_EXTENSION = 'png'


PDF and Word document thumbnails
================================

PDF conversion is done with ImageMagick's ``convert`` program. The default
location where ``sorl.thumbnail`` will look for this program is
``/usr/bin/convert``.

Word documents are converted to a PostScript file with wvWare's ``wvps``
program. The default location where ``sorl.thumbnail`` will look for this
program is ``/usr/bin/wvPS``. This file is then converted to an image with
ImageMagick's ``convert`` program.

To specify an alternate location for either of these programs, add the relevant
property to your settings module::

	THUMBNAIL_CONVERT = '/path/to/imagemagick/convert'
	THUMBNAIL_WVPS = '/path/to/wvPS'


.. _thumbnail-processors:

Thumbnail Processors
====================

By specifying a list of ``THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS`` in your settings module, you
can change (or add to) the processors which are run when you create a
thumbnail. Note that the order of the processors is the order in which they
are called to process the image. Each processor is passed the requested size
and a dictionary containing all options which the thumbnail was called with
(except for *quality*, because that's just used internally for saving).

For example, to add your own processor to the list of possible, you would
create a processor like this::

    def your_processor(image, requested_size, opts):
        if 'your_option' in opts:
            process_image(image)
    your_processor.valid_options = ['your_option']

And add the following to your settings module::

    THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS = (
        # Default processors
        'sorl.thumbnail.processors.colorspace',
        'sorl.thumbnail.processors.autocrop',
        'sorl.thumbnail.processors.scale_and_crop',
        'sorl.thumbnail.processors.filters',
        # Custom processors
        'your_project.thumbnail_processors.your_processor',
    )

Default processors
------------------

colorspace
    This processor is best kept at the top of the list since it will convert
    the image to RGB color space needed by most of following processors. It is
    also responsible for converting an image to grayscale if *bw* option is
    specified.

autocrop
    This will crop the image of white edges and is still pretty experimental.

scale_and_crop
    This will correctly scale and crop your image as indicated.

filters
    This provides the *sharpen* and *detail* options described in the
    options section

Writing a custom processor
--------------------------

A custom processor takes exactly three arguments: The image as a PIL Image
Instance, the requested size as a tuple (width, hight), options as strings
in a list. Your custom processor should return the processed PIL Image instance.
To make sure we provide our tag with valid options and to make those available
to your custom processors you have to attach a list of valid options. This is
simply done by attaching a list called valid_options to your processor as
described in the above example.


Clean-up management command
===========================

The ``thumbnail_cleanup`` management command is used to delete thumbnails that
no longer have an original file. Running it is simple::

    ./manage.py thumbnail_cleanup

How it works
------------
1. It will look through all your models and find ImageFields, then from the
   upload_to argument to that it will find all thumbnails.
2. If then in turn the thumbnail exists but not the original file, it will
   delete the thumbnail.

Limitations
-----------
* It will not even try to delete thumbnails in date formatted directories.
* There can occur name collisions if a file name matches that of a potential
  thumbnail (see ``thumb_re``).


.. _thumbnail-fields:

Thumbnail Fields
================

Two field classes (based on Django's ``ImageField``) are provided for use in
your Django models. They can be imported from ``sorl.thumbnail.fields``.

* ``ThumbnailField`` resizes the source image before saving.
    
* ``ImageWithThumbnailsField`` keeps the original source image but
  provides an easy interface for accessing a predefined thumbnail.

Both fields also allow for :ref:`multiple-thumbnails`, and when the source
image is deleted, any related thumbnails are also automatically deleted.

ThumbnailField
--------------

size (required)
    A 2-length tuple used to size down the width and height of the source image.

options
    A list of options to use when thumbnailing the source image.

quality
    Alter the quality of the JPEG thumbnail.

basedir, subdir and prefix
    Used to override the default :ref:`thumbnail-filenames` settings.

Here is an example model with a ``ThumbnailField``::

    MyModel(models.Model):
        name = models.TextField(max_length=50)
        photo = ThumbnailField(upload_to='profiles',
                               thumbnail={'size': (50, 50)})

ImageWithThumbnailsField
------------------------

A *thumbnail* argument is required for this field. Pass in a dictionary
with the following values (all optional except for *size*):

size
    A 2-length tuple of the thumbnail width and height.

options
    A list of options for this thumbnail.

quality, basedir, subdir and prefix
    Used to override the default :ref:`thumbnail-filenames` settings.

Your model instance's field will have a new property, *thumbnail*, which
returns a ``DjangoThumbnail`` instance for your pleasure (if you use this in a
template, it'll return the full URL to the thumbnail).

Let's look at an example. Here is a model with an ``ImageWithThumbnailsField``::

    MyModel(models.Model):
        name = models.TextField(max_length=50)
        photo = ImageWithThumbnailsField(upload_to='profiles',
                                         thumbnail={'size': (50, 50)})

A template (passed an instance of *MyModel*) would simply use something like:
``<img src="{{ my_model.photo.thumbnail }}" alt="{{ my_model.name }}" />`` or
it could use the :ref:`simple-html-tag`.

.. _simple-html-tag:

Simple HTML tag
---------------

Your model instance's field (for both thumbnail field types) has a new
*thumbnail_tag* property which can be used to return HTML like
``<img src="..." width="..." height="..." alt="" />``.

Now, even simpler for just a basic *img* tag:
``{{ my_model.photo.thumbnail_tag }}``.

Note that when the source image is deleted, any related thumbnails are also
automatically deleted.


.. _multiple-thumbnails:

Multiple Thumbnails
-------------------

If you want to use multiple thumbnails for a single field, you can use the
*extra_thumbnails* argument, passing it a dictionary like so::

    photo = ImageWithThumbnailsField(
        upload_to='profiles',
        thumbnail={'size': (50, 50)},
        extra_thumbnails={
            'icon': {'size': (16, 16), 'options': ['crop', 'upscale']},
            'large': {'size': (200, 400)},
        },
    )

This would allow you to access the extra thumbnails like this:
``my_model.photo.extra_thumbnails['icon']`` (or in a template,
``{{ my_model.photo.extra_thumbnails.icon }}``).

This is available to both thumbnail field types.

Similar to how the :ref:`simple-html-tag` works, you can using the
*extra_thumbnails_tag* property:
``my_model.photo.extra_thumbnails_tag['large']`` (or in a template,
``{{ my_model.photo.extra_thumbnails_tag.large }}``).

When thumbnails are generated
-----------------------------

The normal behaviour is that thumbnails are only generated when they are
first accessed. To have them generated as soon as the source image is saved,
you can set the field's *generate_on_save* attribute to ``True``.

Changing the thumbnail tag HTML
-------------------------------

If you don't like the default HTML output by the thumbnail tag shortcuts
provided by this field, you can use the *thumbnail_tag* argument. For
example, to use HTML4.0 compliant tags, you would do the following::

    photo = ImageWithThumbnailsField(
        upload_to='profiles',
        thumbnail={'size': (50, 50)},
        template_tag='<img src="%(src)s" width="%(width)s" height="%(height)s">'
    )

Generate a different image type than JPEG
-----------------------------------------

PIL chooses which type of image to save as based on the extension so you can
use the *extension* argument to save as a different image type that the
default JPEG format. For example, to make the generated thumbnail a PNG file::

    photo = ImageWithThumbnailsField(
        upload_to='profiles',
        thumbnail={'size': (50, 50), 'extension': 'png'}
    )
    avatar = ThumbnailField(
        upload_to='profiles',
        size=(50, 50),
        extension='png'
    )


This just doesn't cover my cravings!
====================================

1. Use the ``DjangoThumbnail`` class in ``sorl.thumbnail.main`` if you want
   behaviour similar to :ref:`template-tag`. If you want to use a
   different file naming method, just subclass and override the
   *_get_relative_thumbnail* method.

2. Go for the ``Thumbnail`` class in ``sorl.thumbnail.base`` for more
   low-level creation of thumbnails. This class doesn't have any
   Django-specific ties.


.. _filesize-filter:

Filesize filter
===============

This filter returns the number of bytes in either the nearest unit or a
specific unit (depending on the chosen format method). Use this filter to
output user-friendly file sizes. For example::

	{% thumbnail source 200x200 as thumb %}
	Thumbnail file size: {{ thumb.filesize|filesize }}

If the generated thumbnail size came to 2000 bytes, this would output
"Thumbnail file size: 1.9 KiB" (the filter's default format is *auto1024*).
You can specify a different format like so::

	{{ thumb.filesize|filesize:"auto1000long" }}

Which would output "2 kilobytes".

Acceptable formats are:

auto1024, auto1000
    convert to the nearest unit, appending the abbreviated unit name to the
    string (e.g. '2 KiB' or '2 kB'). *auto1024* is the default format.

auto1024long, auto1000long
    convert to the nearest multiple of 1024 or 1000, appending the correctly
    pluralized unit name to the string (e.g. '2 kibibytes' or '2 kilobytes').

kB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, YB
    convert to the exact unit (using multiples of 1000).

KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB, YiB
    convert to the exact unit (using multiples of 1024).

The *auto1024* and *auto1000* formats return a string, appending the
correct unit to the value. All other formats return the floating point value.
